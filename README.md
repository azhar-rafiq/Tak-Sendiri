# Tak Sendiri 

Advanced AI Chatbot for people struggling through depression trained and modeled by our team.

## About
1 in 20 Indonesian youths experience mental health problems, especially depression. Unfortunately, in Indonesia there is no specific hotline to deal with sufferers. To solve this problem, our organization created a solution called "Tak Sendiri".

Mental health disorders such as depression can be fatal, with many Indonesians committing suicide because of this problem. However, these figures are only a fraction of the actual reality.

"Tak Sendiri" believes that implementing Chatbot AI is a good effort to listen to the voices of people with depression in Indonesia. AI datasets and models in Indonesian were trained by medical professionals to detect early depressive symptoms which are expected to prevent suicide cases in Indonesia.
